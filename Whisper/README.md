### Brief Description:
Let's say User-A wants to tell User-B something privately, but they don't have enough time to send a direct message. So, User-A can use the command -whisper @User-B || Private message ||. The bot will delete User-A's message in 0.5 seconds. After 1 second, the bot will send its own message with a button. If User-B clicks on the button, they can see the private text. However, if someone else, like User-C, clicks the button, the bot will prevent them from seeing the message and will show a message saying "This message is not for you." Also, the private message will expire 15 minutes later, whether User-B has seen it or not.
