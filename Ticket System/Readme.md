- [Jump To Installation](https://github.com/YourFriendSub/YAGPDB.xyz-CCs/blob/main/Ticket%20System#Installation) or Just Scroll Down.
> P.S. English isn't my First Language.

## Features
- ‚úÖ Feature 1 - Is Interactive. Uses Buttons, Select Menus & Modals for almost everything.
- ‚úÖ Feature 2 - You can customize, what permissions you want to give to the ticket-owner (e.g. creator of the ticket):
  - `{{$PClose:= true}}`: Permission For Closing the ticket. *Default=True*
    - It removes Ticket-Owner from ticket. If users were added, it'll remove them too.
  - `{{$POpen := true}}`: Permission For Re-Opening the ticket. *Default=True*
    - Added just for my own satisfaction but, can be good in some cases *maybe*.
  - `{{$PAddUser := false}}`: Permission For adding new users to the ticket. *Default=False*
  - `{{$PRemoveUser := false}}`: Permission For removing users from the ticket. *Default=False*
  - `{{$PRename := true}}`: Permission For Renaming the ticket, also edits the Subject & Compose of Top-Message. *Default=True*

- ‚úÖ Featere 3 - Additional features:
