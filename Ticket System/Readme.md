# Interactive Ticket System 

> This is a Ticket system but, it uses Buttons, Select Menus & Modals. This ticket system also has feature to close & re-open ticket without deleting the channel (like Ticket Tool bot).

## Features
- ✅ Feature 1 - Is Interactive. Uses Buttons, Select Menus & Modals for almost everything.
- ✅ Feature 2 - You can customize, what permissions you want to give to the ticket-owner (e.g. creator of the ticket):
  - `{{$PClose:= true}}`: Permission For Closing the ticket. *Default=True*
    - It removes Ticket-Owner from ticket. If users were added *with Select-Menu*, it'll remove them too.
  - `{{$POpen := true}}`: Permission For Re-Opening the ticket. *Default=True*
    - Added just for my own satisfaction but, can be good in some cases *maybe*.
  - `{{$PAddUser := false}}`: Permission For adding new users to the ticket. *Default=False*
  - `{{$PRemoveUser := false}}`: Permission For removing users from the ticket. *Default=False*
  - `{{$PRename := true}}`: Permission For Renaming the ticket, also edits the Subject & Compose of Top-Message. *Default=True*
  - `{{$PAdminOnly := true}}`: Permission For if Ticket-Owner can convert ticket to AdminOnly or not. *Default=True*
  - `{{$PUseSettings := true}}`: Permission For using the “⚙️ Settings” button. *Default=True*
  - `{{$PDelete := false}}`: Permission For deleting the ticket. *Default=False*
  - > NOTE: Here, "DELETE" Means Deleting the Ticket-Channel & "CLOSE" Means just removing the Ticket-Owner and Added Users from the Ticket-Channel.
- ✅ Featere 3 - Additional features:
  - If you want to Pin the Top-Message (e.g. First message that was Sent by bot.) of the Ticket. *Default=True*
  - If you want to Ping Staff role or not. *Default=True*
  - Ticket-Creator can add a Compose/Explanation for making ticket.
  - Sends a Embed on ticket deletation to Log-Channel with details like:
